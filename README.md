# 📖 Overview

TrafficForecast is a **Time Series Forecasting** project designed to analyze urban traffic patterns and predict future traffic congestion using data collected from drone-based traffic monitoring systems.

Instead of forecasting from raw video directly, the project focuses on **traffic data analysis** after vehicle information has been extracted from aerial videos.

The project follows a complete Data Science workflow:

```

Traffic Congestion Prediction
```

# 🎯 Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

- Analyze urban traffic flow
- Explore traffic density patterns
- Build time-series datasets
- Forecast future traffic volume
- Compare forecasting models
- Evaluate prediction accuracy

# 📊 Dataset

The project processes traffic monitoring data extracted from drone videos.

Each observation represents traffic statistics collected during a fixed time interval.

Typical features include:

| Feature | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Timestamp | Observation time |
| Vehicle Count | Number of detected vehicles |
| Average Speed | Average traffic speed |
| Traffic Density | Density of vehicles |
| Vehicle Type | Car, Bus, Truck, Motorcycle |
| Lane Information | Road lane identifier |

The processed dataset is transformed into a **time-series format**, where:

- Time → Index
- Vehicle Count → Prediction Target

---

# 🔄 Workflow

## 1. Data Cleaning

Raw traffic datasets are cleaned by:

- Removing invalid records
- Handling missing values
- Standardizing timestamps
- Formatting columns
- Filtering noisy samples

Script:

```
scripts/clean_each_file.py
```

---

## 2. Time Series Construction

Notebook:

```
01_create_timeseries_dataset.ipynb
```

Tasks:

- Convert timestamps
- Aggregate traffic counts
- Generate fixed interval observations
- Create forecasting dataset

Output:

```
traffic_density_timeseries.csv
```

---

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis

Notebook:

```
02_eda_timeseries.ipynb
```

Includes:

- Distribution analysis
- Correlation analysis
- Vehicle distribution
- Density visualization
- Speed analysis
- Traffic trends

Visualizations include:

- Histogram
- Scatter Plot
- Correlation Heatmap
- Boxplot
- Traffic Density Map
- Vehicle Type Distribution

# 📈 Forecasting Models

The project compares two forecasting approaches.

---

## Model 1 — ARIMA

Notebook:

```
03_baseline_arima.ipynb
```

Pipeline:

```
Time Series

↓

Stationarity Test

↓

ADF Test

↓

ACF / PACF

↓

Grid Search

↓

Best ARIMA Model

↓

Prediction

↓

Evaluation
```

Features:

- Stationarity checking
- Automatic parameter tuning
- Forecast future traffic volume

Outputs:

- Best model

---

## Model 2 — Prophet

Notebook:

```
04_prophet_baseline.ipynb
```

Pipeline:

```

↓

Evaluation
```

Prophet automatically models:

- Trend
- Seasonality
- Holidays (optional)
- Long-term changes

---

# 📊 Evaluation Metrics

The forecasting performance is evaluated using:

- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- MSE (Mean Squared Error)

Comparison between ARIMA and Prophet is performed to determine the better forecasting model.

---

# 📁 Reports

The generated outputs are stored under:

```
reports/
```

Including:

```

│   ├── figures/
│   ├── models/
│   └── tables/
│
└── prophet/
    ├── figures/
    ├── models/
    └── tables/
```

Saved artifacts include:

- Trained models
- Prediction tables
- Evaluation metrics
- Forecast plots
